       "\n",
       "In \"Our Culture,\" I should highlight the community-driven aspect. Perhaps add something funny about the team being nice but probably arguing about their favorite model's performance—like an internal debate. Also, since they are open-source, make a joke comparing them to a DIY Kit for AI, which might be slightly humorous.\n",
       "\n",
       "When talking about the jobs section, I can list some fun roles like \"Professional Hugger\" or \"AI Composer\" with a twist. Maybe make it sound quirky.\n",
